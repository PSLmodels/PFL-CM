## About PFL-CM
PFL-CM (short for Paid Family Leave - Cost Model) is a model to evaluate the total cost of paid family and medical leave policy proposals. PFL-CM uses the 2012 FMLA public use file to estimate take-up, leave duration and other information, which is then applied to the 2017 Current Population Survey to estimate the total cost of the policy.

## Disclaimer
This model is currently under development. The model components and the results may change as the model improves.
